# Time Management quick research from YouTube

I found out that I need a refresher on time management, so I decided to do a quick research on the topic.

Since this could be useful for someone in the future (including future me), I decided to share my notes.

Speaking of time management, I'm making a note of when I started all of this, and when I finished:
Start: 16:20
Finish: 18:20 (but I did a few more things during this)

## 1. [The Philosophy of Time Management | Brad Aeon | TEDxConcordia - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXBA4eWskrc)

- You are GOING TO DIE, got it? I mean, really, got it?
- The main question is: how can we use our time in a way to make it more meaningful?
- How precious is time exactly? If you say time is money, is time with your kids is wasted time, wasted money? No.
- The most fundamental philosophical question (according to some philosopher): "Why shouldn't I kill myself right now?". Yeah, why not? Do you have a **reason** to live?
  - Your answer to that question will remind you what you are truly living for.
- Time is not money when you know you're going to die.
- "I don't have time" is the biggest lie of the history of mankind. It is about **priorities**.
- You can't have it all, you have to make **sacrifices**.
- Time is not money. Time is **life**. Wasting time = **wasting life**.

From this video I have learned that:
- I need to find out what I'm living for -> I need purpose and goals
- I need to prioritize things, and it literally means saying "I won't do that" to many things.
- I need to manage my time deliberately, conciously!


## 2. [How to manage your time more effectively (according to machines) - Brian Christian - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbdXTMnOmE)

- When processing emails, if you always scan all of them all the time to find out the most important, you lose time! (It's a quadratic algorithm.)
  - Instead, just do them in random order, or any order. Just do it, because you may spend more time prioritizing, than doing actual work.
- Getting serious work done means minimizing context switches.
- You can manage interruptions e.g. by grouping them -> check everything with a frequency based on how soon you have to respond to them! In computer science, it is called _interrupt coalescing_ -> grouping interrupts based on how they can afford to wait. 
  - Phone call: immediate interupt. Minimize it.
  - Email: Once a day? Once every 4 hours? Your decision.
  - Social media message: again, YOUR decision. Everything is your decision.

From this video, I have learned:
- Spend less time prioritizing and more time doing
- Minimize interruptions. I actually turned off notifications from several mobile apps. When I feel like, I will check them. (The alternative would have been an option to group notifications every N hours and receive them at once, but Android can't do that, so I turned all notifications off. It's fine.)
- Group interruptions by how long you can afford to NOT do them and then do them in that amount of time.


## 3. [Maximize Productivity With These Time Management Tools | Dr. Cal Newport & Dr. Andrew Huberman - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4dser6ssp0)

- Dr. Cal Newport: "fixed schedule productivity" philosphy: fix the work hour schedule, and work downstream from that for everything else, instead of to-do lists. Fix the schedule, and don't work outside of that schedule.
- exercise results in longer, and mentally sharper lives
- deep work matters (uninterrupted, commited, deeply focused time spent)


## 4. [Tools for Better Productivity & Time Management | Dr. Adam Grant & Dr. Andrew Huberman - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8B0KWmv_-Q)

- After waking the first 0-8 hours is the best for analytical work, work which needs the most focus. And creative, brainstorming work could be better in the afternoon.
- Based on what they talked about, I think most meetings should be in the afternoon (definitely all management meetings).


## 5. [How I Manage My Time - 10 Time Management Tips - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iONDebHX9qk)

1. **We own all of our time**: Your time is entirely within **your** control!
2. **Hell Yeah or No**: If you think "maybe", the answer is NO. Either "Hell, yeah!", or "No". Learn to be able to say no and be okay with it.
3. **The Daily Highlight**: Choose one thing at the beginning of the day which you want to do, and make it "the highlight". Achieve it and you'll be happy. (This can be a fun thing, doesn't have to be a productive one!)
4. **Use a To-Do List**
5. **Time Blocking**: any time you need to do something, make a time block for it in the calendar. For example, the creator always schedules time for his daily highlight.
6. **Parkinson's law**: _work expands to fill the time that we allocate to it_. Create artificial deadlines!
7. **Protected time**: allocate protected time for stuff
8. **Delegation**: Find out how much money your time is worth. E.g. 25 USD/hour. If you have tasks which you hate, you can have others do that for less than that. You can delegate stuff to freelancers, too on like websites like upwork or fiverr. I thougt a bit more about that and found out that it also applies to paid automation services, for example having a better but paid mobile app for something that would save me time may be a good decision.
9. **Automated Scheduling**: Use e.g. Calendly
10. **The Choice to be Satisfied**
